# build

Build with maven.
generate jar linux or windows:

```
$ mvn clean install
```

Windows, generate an exe:

```
$ mvn clean package
```

# java

java 8 is needed to execute alt-scount

# ambit supported

At the moment only tested with my ambit 2R, it should work with all Ambit 2 devices and perhaps Ambit 1.

# android 

Currently working on android.
Not easy to communicate with Usb, but I finally find a solution.
